# Expense-Tracker
Mini Project-1

This is a mini project that allows the user to add, edit, and delete products using localStorage in a web browser. The page contains a form where the user can enter an item name and its price. When the user submits the form, the data is stored in localStorage and displayed on the page along with a running total of the prices of all items added so far.

The JavaScript code defines functions to handle the form submission, update the total price, display the items, and handle edit and delete actions.

When the user clicks on the delete button for an item, the corresponding data is removed from localStorage and the item is removed from the page. When the user clicks on the edit button for an item, the item's data is loaded back into the form, the data is removed from localStorage, and the item is removed from the page so that the user can update the item's data.

The page also includes a function to display all the items stored in localStorage on page load, so that any items previously added are displayed when the page is reloaded.
